## Contributing for HID Key project

Main thought of this project is provide solution for OPS and Tech support teams for easier and affordable (in term of price for ordering pcb and components for such device) instrument for running scripts like RubberDucky does with additional hardware features.


PicoMod version was actually produced in 42 units for our teams and its was a successful experience. Yay!


Now i'm working on HID Key v2, more compact version of PicoMod. Contributors can help with:
1. Because i'm not a professional electronic engineer you may help with evaluation of my schematic and pcb design.
2. Come up with ideas for making this device safier, more ergonomic and better towards with project's goal - cheap, robust and safe usb script injector for work.
